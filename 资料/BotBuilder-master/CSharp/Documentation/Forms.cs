    /// \section Overview
    /// \ref dialogs are very powerful and flexible, but handling a guided conversation like ordering a sandwich
    /// can require a lot of effort. At each point in the dialog, there are many possibilities for what happens
    /// next. You may need to clarify an ambiguity, provide help, go back or show progress so far.  
    /// In order to simplify building guided conversations the framework provides a powerful 
    /// dialog building block known as %FormFlow. %FormFlow sacrifices some of the flexibility provided by dialogs, 
    /// but in a way that requires much less effort. Even better, you can combine %FormFlow generate dialogs and other kinds of dialogs
    /// like a [LuisDialog] to get the best of both worlds.  
    /// A %FormFlow dialog guides the user through filling in the form while providing help and guidance along the way.
    /// 
    /// The clearest way to understand this is to take a look at the \ref simpleSandwichBot sample. 
    /// In that sample you define the form you want using C# classes, fields and properties. 
    /// That is all you need to do to get a pretty good dialog that supports help, clarification, status and 
    /// navigation without any more effort. Once you have that base you can make use of C# attributes and FormBuilder
    /// to improve your bot in a straightforward way as shown in the \ref annotatedSandwich example.
    /// 
    /// \section fields Forms and Fields
    /// %FormFlow starts with the idea of a form--a collection of fields that you want to fill in through a conversation with the user.  
    /// The simplest way to describe a form is through a C# class.  
    /// Within a class, a "field" is any public field or property with one of the following types:
    /// * Integral -- sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong
    /// * Floating point -- float, double
    /// * String
    /// * DateTime
    /// * Enum
    /// * List of enum
    /// 
    /// Any of the data types can also be nullable which is a good way to model that the field does not have a value.
    /// If a field is based on an enum and it is not nullable, then the 0 value in the enum is considered to be null and you should start your enumeration at 1.
    /// Any other fields, properties or methods are ignored by the %FormFlow code. In order to handle a list of complex
    /// objects, you need to create a form for the top level C# class and also one for the complex object. You can
    /// use the \ref dialogs system to compose the forms together.  
    /// It is also possible to define a form directly by implementing Advanced.IField or using Advanced.Field and populating the dictionaries within it. 
    /// In order to better understand FormFlow and its capabilities we will work through two examples, \ref simpleSandwichBot where 
    /// everything is automatically generated and \ref annotatedSandwich where the form is extensively customized.
    /// 
    /// \section simpleSandwichBot Simple Sandwich Bot
    /// As an example of %FormFlow in action, we will outline a simple sandwich ordering form that will be elaborated in \ref annotatedSandwich
    /// to show various features. To start with %FormFlow you need to create a C# class to define the form you want to fill in. 
    /// Like this:
    /// \include SimpleSandwichBot/sandwich.cs
    /// You can see how we import the core Microsoft.Bot.Builder.FormFlow namespace and then define our class.
    /// Included in the class is a static method BuildForm that uses a FormBuilder to build your form. There
    /// are lots of things you can do with the form builder, but we will cover that later and here we just 
    /// define a simple welcome message.
    /// 
    /// In order to connect your form to the bot framework you need to add it to your controller like this:
    /// \dontinclude SimpleSandwichBot/Controllers/MessagesController.cs
    /// \skip MakeRootDialog
    /// \until Post
    /// \until }
    /// 
    /// The combination of your C# class and connecting it to the %Bot Framework is enough to automatically create a conversation.  
    /// Here is an example interaction that demonstrates some of the features offered by %FormFlow. A <b>&gt;</b> symbol shows 
    /// where a response is expected from the user and any input that was entered at that point in the dialog.
    /// ~~~{.txt}

    /// * Adding messages, flow control and confirmations.  
    /// 
    /// \subsection attributes Attributes
    /// %FormFlow includes some C# attributes you can add to your class to better control the dialog.  
    /// Here are the attributes:
    /// 
    /// Attribute | Purpose
    /// ----------| -------
    /// [Describe] | Change how a field or a value is shown in a template as a choice or in a card.
    /// [Numeric] | Provide limits on the values accepted in a numeric field.
    /// [Optional]| Mark a field as optional which means that one choice is not to supply a value.
    /// [Pattern] | Define a regular expression to validate a string field.
    /// [Prompt]| Define a prompt to use when asking for a field.
    /// [Template] | Define a template that is used to generate prompts or values in prompts.
    /// [Terms] | Define the input terms that match a field or value.
    /// 
    /// Let's look at how these attributes can improve your bot. First off, we might want to change the the prompt for SandwichOrder.Sandwich from the
    /// automatically generated "Please select a sandwich" to "What kind of sandwich would you like?". To do this we would use the [Prompt] attribute like this:
    /// \dontinclude AnnotatedSandwichBot/AnnotatedSandwich.cs
    /// \skip Prompt
    /// \until ]
    /// \skip SandwichOptions
    /// \until ;
    /// 
    /// One thing you will notice is the the prompt contains the funny strings "{&}" and "{||}".  
    /// That is because prompt and message strings are written in \ref patterns where you can
    /// have parts of the string that are filled in when the actual prompt or message is generated.  
    /// In this case "{&}" means fill in the description of the field and "{||}" means 
    /// show the choices that are possible. The description of a field is automatically generated from the field name, 
    /// but you could also use a Describe attribute to override that.  
    /// By adding this attribute, the prompt for SandwichOrder.Sandwich now looks like:
    /// ~~~{.txt}
    /// What kind of sandwich would you like?

    /// So far we have improved your dialog via attributes and business logic. There is 
    /// another way to improve your dialog and that is through the FormBuilder. The FormBuilder
    /// allows more fine-grained control over the steps in your conversation and lets you put in messages
    /// and more friendly confirmations. By default the steps specified in the builder
    /// are executed in order.  (Steps might be skipped if there is already a value, or if there
    /// is explicit navigation.)  Here is a more complex usage of FormBuilder:
    /// \dontinclude AnnotatedSandwichBot/AnnotatedSandwich.cs
    /// \skip static
    /// \until .Build
    /// \until }
    /// 
    /// This looks complex, but that is because of the addition of advanced features like validation and dynamically defined fields.
    /// (See \ref dynamicFields for more information.)
    /// The main structure is all about defining the default step order. Here are the steps: 
    /// * Show the welcome message.
    /// * Fill in SandwichOrder.Sandwich
    /// * Fill in SandwichOrder.Length    
    /// * Fill in SandwichOrder.Bread  
    /// * Fill in SandwichOrder.Cheese
    /// * Fill in SandwichOrder.Toppings and transform the value by complementing the list if it includes everything.
    /// * Show a message confirming the selected toppings.      
    /// * Fill in SandwichOrder.Sauces  
    /// * Dynamically defined field for SandwichOrder.Specials.  (See \ref dynamicFields for more information.)
    /// * Dynamically defined confirmation for the cost
    /// * Fill in SandwichOrder.DeliveryAddress and verify the resulting string. If it does not start with a number we return a message.
    /// * Fill in SandwichOrder.DeliveryTime with a custom prompt.  
    /// * Confirm the order.    
    /// * Add any remaining fields in the order they are defined in your class.  (If this was left out, those steps to fill in those fields would not be included.)
    /// * Show a final thank you message.  
    /// * Define an OnCompletionAsync handler to process the order.
    /// 
    /// In the SandwichOrder.DeliveryTime prompt and the confirmation message you can see an instance of
    /// the \ref patterns where pattern elements like {Length} are filled in from your C# class
    /// before the string is shown to the user.
    /// 
    /// \subsection dynamicFields Dynamically Defined Fields, Confirmations and Messages
    /// FormBuilder also allows you to do other more advanced things like dynamically switch on
    /// and off parts of your form based on the state of your object or dynamically define fields
    /// rather than drive them off a C# class.  
    /// 
    /// In order to define a dynamic field, you can implement Advanced.IField yourself, 
    /// but it is easier to make use of the Advanced.FieldReflector class. Imagine we would like to 
    /// create some specials for free drinks and cookies but only for foot-long sandwiches.  
    /// The first step for using Advanced.FieldReflector is to define
    /// the underlying field that will contain your dynamic value, like this:
    /// \dontinclude AnnotatedSandwichBot/AnnotatedSandwich.cs
    /// \skip Sauces
    /// \skip Optional
    /// \until Specials
    /// 
    /// We can apply normal attributes to this field like [Optional] to mark the field as allowing a no preference choice and by changing the template 
    /// value for TemplateUsage.NoPreference. 
    /// 
    /// Now we need to add the dynamic part to the FormBuilder like this:
    /// \dontinclude AnnotatedSandwichBot/AnnotatedSandwich.cs
    /// \skip nameof(Specials)
    /// \until }))
    /// 
    /// There are a couple of pieces here:
    /// * Advanced.Field.SetType sets the type of the field--in this case null which means enumeration.
    /// * Advanced.Field.SetActive provides a delegate that enables the field only when the length is a foot long.  
    /// * Advanced.Field.SetDefine provides an async delegate for defining the field. The delegate is passed the current state object and also the Advanced.Field that is being dynamically defined.  
    /// The delegate uses the fluent methods found on the field to dynamically define values. In this case we define values as strings and supply the descriptions and terms for the value.    
    /// 
    /// Messages and confirmations can also be defined dynamically. Messages and confirmations only run when the prior steps are inactive
    /// or are completed. This is a confirmation that computes the cost of the sandwich:
    /// \dontinclude AnnotatedSandwichBot/AnnotatedSandwich.cs
    /// \skip Confirm
    /// \until })
    /// 
    /// It is also possible to create a %FormFlow experience without any C# class at all. The easiest way to do that

    /// \subsection localizingSection Localization
    /// Once you have a great bot working in a single language, you might want to enable it in other languages.  
    /// The localization language is determined by the current thread's [CurrentUICulture] and [CurrentCulture].  
    /// By default the culture comes from the Language field of the current message, but you can change that if you wish. 
    /// Depending on your bot, there can be up to 3 different sources of localized information including:
    /// * The built-in localization for PromptDialog and %FormFlow.  
    /// * A resource file generated from the static strings found in your form.
    /// * A resource file you create with strings for dynamically computed fields, messages or confirmations.
    /// 
    /// The static strings in a form include strings that are generated from the information in your C# class and from the strings you supply as prompts, 
    /// templates, messages or confirmations. It does not include strings generated from built-in templates since those are already localized. Since many strings 
    /// are automatically generated, it is not easy to use normal C# resource strings directly. For this reason we have provided the code to easily
    /// extract all of the static strings in a form by either:
    /// 1. Call IFormBuilder.SaveResource on your form to save a .resx file.
    /// 2. Use the supplied `rview` tool included in the NuGet package to generate a resource file from your .dll or .exe by specifying the assembly containing your static form building method and the path to that method. For example, the resource file Microsoft.Bot.Sample.AnnotatedSandwichBot.SandwichOrder.resx was generated by calling:
    /// ~~~~
    /// rview -g Microsoft.Bot.Sample.AnnotatedSandwichBot.dll Microsoft.Bot.Sample.AnnotatedSandwichBot.SandwichOrder.BuildForm
    /// ~~~~
    /// Here for example are a few lines from the automatically generated .resx file:
    /// \dontinclude AnnotatedSandwichBot/Resource/Microsoft.Bot.Sample.AnnotatedSandwichBot.SandwichOrder.resx
    /// \skip Specials_description;VALUE
    /// \until sandwichs?
    /// \until data

    /// In order to make use of a generated resource file, add it to your project and then set the neutral language by:
    /// 1. Right-click on your project and select the 'Application' tab.
    /// 2. Click on the 'Assembly Information' button.
    /// 3. Select the language you developed your bot in from the `Neutral Language` drop down.
    /// 
    /// With these changes, when your form is created the IFormBuilder.Build method will automatically
    /// look for resources that contain your form type name and use them to localize all of the static strings in your form. 
    /// 
    /// Dynamic fields defined using Advanced.Field.SetDefine cannot be localized since the strings in them are used to dynamically construct values when
    /// actually filling out a form. To localize these you can make use of the normal C# localization where a C# class for string resources 
    /// is automatically generated for you. 
    /// 
    /// Once you have the resource files added to your project you need to localize them. The easiest way to do this to make use of the Multilingual App Toolkit [MAT].
    /// We use that for our own localizations.  (And would love if people want to contribute new or improved ones.)  
    /// If you install [MAT] you can enable it on a project by:
    /// 1. Select your project in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer
    /// 2. Click on `Tools->Multilingual App Toolkit->Enable selection` to enable your project.
    /// 3. Right click on the project and select `Multilingual App Toolkit->Add Translations` to select the translations.

    /// "..." within a pattern element means multiple elements are allowed.  "<format>" within a pattern element means that you
    /// can optionally specify a regular C# format specifier, i.e. if "Rating" were a double field I could show it with
    /// two digits of precision by using the pattern element "{Rating:F2}".  "<n>" shows where you can specify a reference to the nth
    /// argument of a template.  (See TemplateUsage to see what arguments each template can use.)
    /// 
    /// Pattern Element | Description
    /// --------------- | -----------
    /// {<format>} | Value of the current field.
    /// {&} | Description of the current field.
    /// {<field><format>} | Value of a particular field. 
    /// {&<field>} | Description of a particular field.
    /// {\|\|} | Show the current choices which can be the current value, no preference or the possible values for enumerated fields.
    /// {[{<field><format>} ...]} | Create a list with all field values together utilizing [Separator] and [LastSeparator] to separate the individual values.
    /// {*} | Show one line for each active field with the description and current value.
    /// {*filled} | Show one line for each active field that has an actual value with the description and current value.
    /// {<nth><format>} | A regular C# format specifier that refers to the nth arg. See TemplateUsage to see what args are available.
    /// {?<textOrPatternElement>...} | Conditional substitution. If all referred to pattern elements have values, the values are substituted and the whole expression is used.
    ///
    /// Patterns are used in [Prompt] and [Template] attributes.  
    /// [Prompt] defines a prompt to the user for a particular field or confirmation.  
    /// [Template] is used to automatically construct prompts and other things like help.
    /// There is a built-in set of templates defined in FormConfiguration.Templates.
    /// A good way to see examples of the pattern language is to look at the templates defined there.
    /// A [Prompt] can be specified by using it as an attribute on a particular field or property or implicitly defined through IFormBuilder<T>.Field.
    /// A default [Template] can be overridden on a class or field basis.  
    /// Both prompts and templates support the formatting parameters outlined below.
    /// 
    /// Usage | Description
    /// ------|------------
    /// [AllowDefault] | When processing choices using {\|\|} controls whether the current value should be showed as a choice.
    /// [ChoiceCase] | When processing choices for {\|\|} controls case normalization for each choice.
    /// [ChoiceFormat] | When processing choices for {\|\|} controls how each choice is formatted. {0} is the choice number and {1} the choice description.
    /// [ChoiceLastSeparator] | When inline choice lists are constructed for {\|\|} provides the separator before the last choice.
    /// [ChoiceParens] | When inline choice lists are constructed for {\|\|} indicates whether or not they are in parentheses.
    /// [ChoiceSeparator] | When inline choice lists are constructed for {\|\|} provides the separator before every choice except the last.
    /// [ChoiceStyle] | When processing choices using {\|\|} controls whether the choices are presented in line or per line.
    /// [Feedback] | For [Prompt] only controls feedback after user entry.
    /// [FieldCase] | Controls case normalization when displaying a field description.
    /// [LastSeparator] | When lists are constructed for {[]} provides the separator before the last item.
    /// [Separator] | When lists are constructed for {[]} provides the separator before every item except the last.
    /// [ValueCase] | Controls case normalization when displaying a field value.
    ///
