\page connector %Connector Service 
The %Bot Framework %Connector service is a component which provides a single API for your bot to communicate across
multiple client services such as Skype, Email, Slack. The service is made up of a REST API, common JSON schema for
communicating information between the user and the bot and client libraries in .NET and NodeJS to make it easy to 
program to.

The following sections provide details of how the schema and APIs are used to build a bot.
